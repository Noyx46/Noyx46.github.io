        <h1>Noyx Codex: Index</h1>
        <p>This is a private test of Github pages, where I will store some information about various things to help myself.
        Unfortunately, I am rather inexperienced with web design and HTML (and related languages) in general, so this will be
        mostly for private use.</p>

        <p>What you're looking at is the index page, where links to all other relevant pages will be accessible. Currently, however,
        it is empty.</p>

        <p>If there is a time in which I need to be contacted, this can be done through Discord, id <code>_Syzygion#2742</code>.</p>

        <h1>Fonts</h1>
        <p>The fonts being used are Open Sans (for titles) and Lora (for the body).</p>
