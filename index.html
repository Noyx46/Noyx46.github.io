            <h1>Noyx Codex: Index</h1>
            <p>This is a private test of Github pages, where I will store some information about various things to help myself.
            Unfortunately, I am rather inexperienced with web design and HTML (and related languages) in general, so this will be
            mostly for private use. At this point, I am mostly testing out various CSS "things" that can be done from several
            sources.</p>

            <p>What you're looking at is the index page, where links to all other relevant pages will be accessible. Currently, however,
            it is empty.</p>

            <p>If there is a time in which I need to be contacted, this can be done through Discord, id <code>_Syzygion#2742</code>.</p>

            <h1>Fonts</h1>
            <p>The fonts being used are Open Sans (for titles) and Lora (for the body).</p>
